# Multicap_Dx_Web_UI
This Flask app is a Multicap Dx web interface that captures 160×160 grayscale images from the MCU, calculates scores for four ROIs (Internal, HIV, HBV, HCV), and shows positive/negative results. Users can adjust ROIs, view overlays, and download CSVs, while the backend handles image capture and ROI data processing.
